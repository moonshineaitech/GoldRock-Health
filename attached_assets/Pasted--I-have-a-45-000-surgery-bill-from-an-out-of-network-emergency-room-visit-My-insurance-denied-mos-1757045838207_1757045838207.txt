Given your bill amount, type of care (surgery), insurance status (denied), and financial situation (annual income $55,000), here's a detailed plan you can follow:

First, request an itemized bill from the hospital to identify any billing errors. Use the following script:

*"I am requesting a complete itemized statement for all services provided during my recent treatment. I need every charge broken down with corresponding CPT and ICD-10 procedure codes, service dates, provider NPI numbers, and medical record account details for verification.

To provide the most accurate advice, I need more details about your situation. However, I can give some general next steps based on common scenarios.

**If you recently received a large medical bill:**
1. Request an itemized bill from the provider using this script: "I am requesting a complete itemized statement for all services provided during my recent treatment. I need every charge broken down with corresponding CPT and ICD-10 procedure codes, service dates, provider NPI numbers, and medical record account details for verification. Please provide this within 5 business days as required under federal patient rights regulations."
2. Review the itemized bill using the expert error detection checklist. Look for duplicate charges, services billed but never received, wrong procedure codes, unbundled charges, incorrect dates/times/patient information, wrong insurance information, charges for equipment not used, and room charges for time you didn't spend in the facility.
3. If you find errors, send a dispute letter: "I am formally disputing specific charges on account #[number] due to documented billing errors. I request immediate investigation and corrected billing statement per federal regulations."
4. Research fair market prices for the services you received using tools like the Healthcare Bluebook and FAIR Health Consumer. 
5. Negotiate the bill down using your research and the billing errors you found as leverage. Offer to make a prompt payment for a discount.
