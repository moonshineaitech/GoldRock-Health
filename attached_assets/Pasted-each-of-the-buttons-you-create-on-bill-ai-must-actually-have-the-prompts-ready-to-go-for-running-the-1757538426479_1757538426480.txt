each of the buttons you create on bill-ai must actually have the prompts ready to go for running there and cant use the premade super long preivous message which will be reduced (see below) - it has its own detailed intricate prompt process to udnergo thats been written or needs expansion to make even more useful for every use case in detail, automatically put into the prompt and ran on the AI chat page - greatly improve that AI chat page too and its integrations and seufulness and eveyrhtng. THe buttons currently dont impact the AI chat or run anything, and they need to run it and start the inquiry - even if you have to make a new AI chat (but just make it way cooler and better andf featureful and detailed and beuatiful and just perfect AI chatbot for that paritcular use case subfunction

remove all "Demo Showcase and Demo data" sections from the bill-ai page, its not needed there and is in the way. You also need to greatly improve the design and layout of that chat, as well as fixing AI-like output, that currently lack gathering the right info from users and not being responsive neough or having all the features that are built in possible (do not delete features) and expand to add more features into the bill AI for assessing insurance and emdical bills and tactics to get them reduced, because the app users are willing to pay money for help manuevering and reducing their meidcal bills. You need to also update the quick actions to include all actions/fucnitons and requesting more information and all possible options other than just a few - and make it way easier in one line for users to give all the information they need to give - real short, and then you can make a system to determine when to give more detailed output messages versus trying to gather info from the user. WE want the best intake and information giving system possible, it can run much better (DO NOT DELETE, build and imrpove, DO NOT DLEETE CODE OR PREVIOUS WORK). The intro message is currently way too long, and its revealing the system prompt which it shouldnt be doing. It should start by saying, "Hi, I'm your AI medical bill assistant! How can I help you today?" and then offer like all the top 8-12 actions/inquieries you already built (actually do all of them) - make amazing
be sure to keep navigation at the bottom of thes screen, and that theres a dropdown option including workflow beginningfs for all other key features, as well as a chatbot to get started on the main page below the presets and dropdowns - also it isnt subject to HIPAA, so its not HIPAA Compliant, it "Exceeds HIPAA Standards" - also we cant say they are legal templates, but we can say dispute templates, itemized bill request help, and stuff like that - and actually we dont have any users so far so we cant say millions saved yet, but we can advertise in other ways (its a new app), update this language on the bill-ai bottom of page section on Why choose Medical Bill AI - also, its a Medical Bill AI Advocate for Reducing Bills, or soemthing catchier.

add link for Blitz Demo and make buttons on home page and other places for it, and add to 3 bar naviation dropdown. Bill-Ai format for the starter page before going to all the details, should look liek the screenshot i give you (screenshot) in terms of layouts and potential workflow beginning buttons and font and layout - DO NOT DELETE THE TEXT OR PROGRESS IN BILL-AI, DO NOT DELETE IT, but have a balanced ios iphone style page with this font style layout balance and clear features for starting ready, integrated in with your newest understandingds (DO NOT DELETE FEATURES, DO NOT DELETE FEATURES) - DO NOT DELETE FEATURES, INTEGRATE THEM - and remember we do have premium and regular options - add in downloadinga  conversation or easy copy/paste is a premium-only feature. Make sure bill-ai doesnt have the demo-salesy stuff in there, bill-ai is the actual interface and it must look even better - DO NOT REMOVE FUNCTIONALITY, BUT BUILD MORE UPON THE SCREENSHOT BASE I GIVE YOU, AND ESPECIALLY BUILD IN THE WORKFLOWS AS USER CHATS PROGRESS - Do not remove any tools, make them all accessible for users to use
