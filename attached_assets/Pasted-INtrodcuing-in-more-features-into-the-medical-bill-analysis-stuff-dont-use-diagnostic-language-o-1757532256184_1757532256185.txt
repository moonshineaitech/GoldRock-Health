INtrodcuing in more features into the medical bill analysis stuff - dont use “diagnostic” language or language that we cant use due to medical legal stuff
Formatting of bill-ai page additional features so they are balanced (specific, not mass agent)
Full premium feature build and paywall behind Stripe integration into accounts after payment, and premium features (maybe access a separate premium AI chat page, only accessible by subscribers, and that has the AI features in it, which starts as literally just a clone of the working one and then add the features into the new premium paywalled version)

Stripe subscription ability, to give that particular account premium access - must be successful. $Change pricing to $20/m and $189/year, and make it all work with Stripe.

 integrate and turn on Stripe payment for premium, including premium access for some of the features like the Dispute Letter & Templates, and all of the bill-AI drowndown menu options (all premium behind access paywall - immediately route non-premium users to the premium buy page. Do not delete previously make stuff, if you make new stuff make it behind the paywall. Those extensive functionalities were removed in the redesign but are key features and process paths that the user can go down, especially after buying premium - expand premium features integration and requirement on the Bill AI too keeping with redesign, but having even more endless functionality without deleted old functionality.

Also, put the "Choose Your Plan" Premium subscription at the top fo the premium page, not at the bottom. you also need to build the premium specific pages for the medical bill reducing best practices and industry insights +detailed guides

On the language on the Home page and other pages like the initial landing page and others: Change and remove language around "Medical Assistant", HIPAA Complaint Claims (we are not subject to hipaa, we "Exceed HIPPA Standards", Partnership claims (we dont have), KPI claims need to be changed ($10-500K claim is too extreme - this is meant to be a consumer advocate for manuevering expensive healthcare and insurance and hostpital bills and providing knowledge and tools to get those bills reduced (consumer AI app) focus on the bill error savings, and industry knowledge on redcuing bill amounts, which CAN be in the tens of thousands - but also the Average user des not save $127,000 and similar - Claims, 10-$500K claim, $127K claim adjusted and put into perspective - users COULD save tens of thousands on bills, improve the marketing  - make the language professional and app ready without making up claims or making up partners/reviews we dont have - make it compelling and balanced too. We are advertising this as a tool for actual everyday people who can use this app to reduce their ginormous medical/hospital bills they may have, and help them maneuver the system, a system many people distrurst and dont like a lot. This app identifies the errors in medical billing and overbilling and acts as your advocate to walk you thrrough the process of reducing your medical bills, helping you write structure and assess and utilize industry insights, directly through an app. 

make sure the bill-ai is as compelling and featureful as possible, will demo this for people really quickly in person to get them to sign up, so the bill-ai needs to wow the users and be genuinely valuable and have these multiple workflow options that are super valuable for this type of customer - build a second separate blitz view (WITHOUT EDITING OR REMVING THE CURRENT FLOW) to give a quick wowing feature/value showcase demo/worfklow with just a few clicks.
