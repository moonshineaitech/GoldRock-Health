"I really appreciate Elizabeth's kind, thorough, and dedicated support. I got a significant discount on my bill. But even if I didn't get that much discount, having someone honed in the medical billing system look at my bills and ensure everything is billed correctly makes me feel so much better.



I'm telling all my friends to check out Granted when they get sizable medical bills!"
